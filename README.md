# Binary_Tree_Alphabet
C program to demonstrate binary tree with Traversal.

This is a special case of binary tree with traversal-alphabet.

          Q:Demo - A -999       { A should be the root node.
                   A B C -999   { A is the parent node, B is the left child ,C is the right child.
                   B NULL D     { B is the parent node, left child is NULL , D is the right child.
                   C F NULL     { C is the parent node, F is the left child , right child is NULL.
                   -999         { Exit with traversal}


       Soln: Inorder-Traversal : B D A F C
